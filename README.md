# Agile_Management



## A desktop application to track project progress, based on the Agile Framework Concept.

The program uses python constructed in the agile framework format. For now, with it being a desktop application 
there can only be one person recording the data on their computer (until an online database can be created to then update all other users of the project). 
The program allows users to:

* Create and keep record of all projects you are in,
* Record scrum, project, and daily meetings,
* Identify and separate project items into individual task per users,
* Identify task based on scrum periods




## You can try out the project by using the link below:

http://enricoeverett.tech/assets/exeFile/agileEXE.zip



## How to install:

1. Download the ZIP file
2. Place both files (database and exe files) in the same place you want to be accessing them from
3. Open the exe file to use the program



## ISSUES:
It does take some time before the program loads up!
